### What's Chorerunner

Chorerunner is a React chore application where Users can sign up for an account and assign chores to members of their familes. The app allows users to make a game out of household chores, which will make them more likely to actually complete them! The user can assign point values to the tasks. The family member with the highest point total is the winner.
